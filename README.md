# SteamCMD JavaScript Interface

This library allows you to access
[SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) via Node.js on
Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Setup

-

A [maintained Node version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).
This is currently versions >= 18.

- Install
  the [dependencies for `node-pty`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pty?activeTab=readme#dependencies)
  - **For Windows users**:
    - [Windows-Build-Tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
      these can be installed via the following command:
      ```shell script
      npm install --global windows-build-tools
      ```
    - [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/),
      only the "Desktop C++ Apps" components need to be installed
  - **For Linux users**:
    - _Make_, _Python_, and _build essential_. On Ubuntu these can be installed
      like this:
      ```shell script
      sudo apt install -y make python build-essential
      ```
  - **For Mac users**:
    - Xcode Command Line Tools. These might be installed already. If you can’t
      install this package, then run:
      ```shell script
      xcode-select --install
      ```

      If you’re still having trouble, then see the troubleshooting section
      below.

## Basic Usage Example

1. Install the package
   ```sh
   npm install steamcmd-interface
   ```

2. Import the class and create a new instance using the `init` function. This
   is an _asynchronous_ function that downloads all the binaries, creates a new
   instance of SteamCmd, ensures that it can run, and then returns the instance.
   ```js
   import { SteamCmd } from 'steamcmd-interface'

   const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init({})
   ```

3. Now you can use the instance to interact with SteamCMD. You can log in with
   your user account or anonymously (default), update apps, or run a series of
   commands.

   The `updateApp` function is an async generator that reports on the progress
   of the update as it gets output from the underling SteamCMD process.
   ```js
   // Downloads CS:GO dedicated server to the default install directory.
   for await(const progress of steamCmd.updateApp(740)) {
     // Logs something like "downloading 1.2%"
     console.log(`${progress.state} ${progress.progressPercent}%`)
   }
   ```

## Construction

A new `SteamCmd` object **cannot** be created using the `new` keyword. It will
throw an error. You must use the `SteamCmd.init` async function. This is because
construction is fundamentally asynchronous.

### Options

An option object can be passed to the `SteamCmd.init` function to configure
the behaviour of the instance. The following options are available:

- `binDir`: The path to which the SteamCMD binaries will be downloaded to.
  Default to "[the module's base directory]/temp/install_dir/[platform string]"
- `installDir`: To where SteamCMD will download all applications. Default to
  "[the module's base directory]/temp/install_dir"
- `username`: The username to log in as. Defaults to "anonymous"

### Examples

- Changing the installation directory to install apps to the current working
  directory.
  ```js
  SteamCmd.init({
    installDir: process.cwd()
  })
  ```
- Setting a username for downloading purchased games.

  **Note** that this will only work if you successfully logged in once and
  SteamCMD has your credentials cached. See the ["Logging In"](#logging-in)
  section below for more details.
  ```js
  SteamCmd.init({
    username: 'example'
  })
  ```

## Logging In

SteamCmd offers two login-related functions:

- `isLoggedIn` simply tests if the currently saved username is logged in with
  SteamCMD. If this returns true, then SteamCMD has access to your library, and
  you can run actions related to your library, such as downloading games.
- `login` uses the given username, password, and Steam Guard code to log in.
  This will resolve if the login was successful or throw an error if the login
  failed.

### Examples

1. By default, on initialisation SteamCmd logs in anonymously, therefore the
   login test returns true.
   ```js
   const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init()
   console.log(await steamCmd.isLoggedIn()) // Logs "true"
   ```
2. If we initialise with a username that we’ve never logged in as then the
   login test returns false.
   ```js
   const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init({
     username: 'example'
   })
   console.log(await steamCmd.isLoggedIn()) // Logs "false"
   ```
3. Logging in with correct credentials.
   ```js
   const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init({
     // Specifying the username here is not strictly necessary, because the
     // call to "login" below will update the internally saved username.
     username: 'example'
   })
   await steamCmd.login('example', 'password123', 'AABB2')
   console.log(await steamCmd.isLoggedIn()) // Logs "true"
   ```
4. If we initialise with a username that we’ve previously logged in with, then
   SteamCMD will use the cached credentials to log us in. Therefore, we don't
   need to call the "login" function.
   ```js
   const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init({
     username: 'example'
   })
   console.log(await steamCmd.isLoggedIn()) // Logs "true"
   ```

## Updating Apps (i.e. Downloading Games)

You can download games into the installation directory by using the `updateApp`
function. It's an asynchronous generator function that yields an object that
reports on the current progress of the update. If you’re logged in, then you
will have access to your Steam library.

You have to give `updateApp` the app ID of the game that you want to download.
You can search for your game to get the app ID on
[Steam DB](https://steamdb.info/search/?a=app).

This function also optionally accepts the platform type and bitness of the
application. This will allow you to download, for example, Windows games on a
Mac. If omitted, then the platform and bitness of the current operating system
are used.

### Example

```js
const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init()

// Downloads Windows 32bit CS:GO dedicated server to the default install
// directory.
for await(const progress of steamCmd.updateApp(740, 'windows', 32)) {
  // Logs something like
  // {
  //   stateCode: '0x61',
  //   state: 'downloading',
  //   progressPercent: 0.65,
  //   progressAmount: 156521223,
  //   progressTotalAmount: 24015919696
  // }
  console.log(progress)
}

// Once the loop above has completed then the app has been successfully
// downloaded
```

## Running Arbitrary commands

You can run a series of commands using the `run` function. It accepts an array
of strings. Each sting must be a command that SteamCMD can run. An exhaustive
list of all available commands is available in
[this repository](https://github.com/dgibbs64/SteamCMD-Commands-List/blob/master/steamcmd_commands.txt).

This function is an asynchronous generator function. It yields each line of
output from SteamCMD. It will throw an error if an error occurred.

### Example

```js
const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init()

// Uninstall the CS:GO dedicated server
const commands = [
  'app_uninstall -complete 740'
]

for await(const line of steamCmd.run(commands)) {
  console.log(line)
}
```

## Error Handling

Some function can throw a `SteamCmdError` error (most notably the `run` and
`updateApp` generators). This error object's `message` property is generated
based on the exit code that the SteamCMD binary returned. In addition, the
original exit code can be retrieved via the `exitCode` property.

The class also has a few useful statics, such as the `EXIT_CODES` object, and
the `getErrorMessage` function.

### Example

```js
const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init()

// Try to download Half-Life 2
try {
  for await(const progress of steamCmd.updateApp(220)) {
    console.log(progress)
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Logs "The application failed to install for some reason. Reasons include:
  // you do not own the application, you do not have enough hard drive space, a
  // network error occurred, or the application is not available for your
  // selected platform." This is because we logged in anonymously above and are
  // therefore not allowed to download Half-Life 2.
  console.log(error.message)

  // Logs "8"
  console.log(error.exitCode)

  // Logs "The application failed to install for some reason. Reasons include:
  // you do not own the application, you do not have enough hard drive space, a
  // network error occurred, or the application is not available for your
  // selected platform."
  console.log(SteamCmdError.getErrorMessage(error.exitCode))

  // Logs all the currently known exit codes.
  console.log(SteamCmdError.EXIT_CODES)
}
```

## Debugging

You can enable debug logging where SteamCmd will log each line of output to the
console. There are two ways you can enable debug logging:

- By setting `enableDebugLogging` to `true` in the `init` function.
  ```js
  SteamCmd.init({ enableDebugLogging: true })
  ```
- By setting a class variable to true. This is useful for enabling or disabling
  debug logging after initialisation.
  ```js
  const steamCmd = await SteamCmd.init()

  // ... Later ...

  steamCmd.enableDebugLogging = true
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- `gyp ERR! find VS gyp ERR! find VS msvs_version not set from command line or
  npm config`
  - Run `npm config set msvs_version 2017`. This is because native extensions on
    Windows are built using the Visual Studio build tools. If no version is set,
    then the build fails.
- `Error: The module '[...]/pty.node' was compiled against a different Node.js`
  - Run `npm rebuild`
- `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!`
  - If you are running macOS Catalina, then see
    [this](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md)
    extensive troubleshooting guide.
  - If you are not on macOS Catalina, then try one of the following:
    1. Run
       ```shell script
       xcode-select --install
       ```
    2. Run
       ```shell script
       sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select --print-path)
       xcode-select --install
       ```
    3. See the macOS Catalina guide above. It's still useful even if you don't
       run the same OS version.
- `error: no member named 'GetContents' in 'v8::ArrayBuffer'`
  - Use Node <=16
